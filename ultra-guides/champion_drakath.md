Notes:

* Requires strict timing and some mana reduction classes.
* **Every 2 million HP** the boss sends out a nuke and gets stronger, it is **RECOMMENDED to Taunt** this so it hits 1 player instead of all 4 in the party.
* He also gets stronger each time he does the nuke so if a taunt is missed it is recommended to reset. It is **USELESS to Taunt at 10 million hp**
* At 50% Health (10 million) he applies *mana and health gain debuff*
* At 20% Health (2 million) **TAUNTS won't matter**, **kill him fast!**
* CaV users **must not lag**
* Chrono Nukes won't work due to his high nuke resistance, trying will make him stronger
