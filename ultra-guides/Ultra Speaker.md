Alright this is probably the most difficult Ultra amongst the ones listed here. This information is mainly from the Misfit guild.

## 4 Man Taunt

Red zone counting method by Mathieu:

You have a 2 second window to taunt after the yellow messages appear.

Learn the following lines related to your class, and count the red nukes during the fight to nail every single taunt. 

> **LR:** Stay inside 1st RED, taunt LISTEN after 1st and 3rd red zones.
> **AP**: Stay inside 2nd RED, taunt right after 2nd and 4th red zones.
> **LoO**: Stay inside 3rd RED, taunt right after 1st and 3rd red zones.
> **QCM**: Stay inside 4th RED, taunt 2nd truth after 2nd and 4th red zones (and you run out of range when it says listen).

Class jobs during the fight:
> **LR**: Use decay (skill 2) when red zones appear to prevent Malgor from healing.
> **AP**: Spam heal (if possible heal BEFORE red zones)
> **LoO**: Spam heal (if possible heal AFTER the red zones)
> **QCM**: Focus on damage.

Enhancements:
> **LR**: Arcana, Lucky, Lucky, Vainglory
> **AP**: Ravenous/Valiance, Lucky, Base Forge, Pentinence/Lucky
> **LoO**: Awe Blast, Lucky, Base Forge, Pentinence
> **QCM**: Ravenous/Valiance, Lucky, Fighter, Pentinence

Consumables:
> **LR**: Fate Tonic, Potent Destruction Elixir
> **AP**: Fate Tonic, Potent Destruction Elixir
> **LoO**: Fate Tonic, Potent Destruction Elixir
> **QCM**: Fate Tonic, Potent Destruction Elixir

QCM can be swapped to VHL, VDK, SC (why), CAV.

## 3 Man Taunt

Due to no taunts for the DPS, you can actually run something frail like CSS (or VHL) and full pot for fast 1-1.5 cycle clears, generally recommended to run 3 man taunt over 4 man taunt in most situations. This is because people tend to make mistakes the longer a fight goes on, and this just limits the length of this fight.

## Mole Chart

Average pubs experience, thought I might as well put this here as pubs donâ€™t really deviate much from this and I want this to be a resource that all players can use. Here I present one of the first speaker charts made by mole.
