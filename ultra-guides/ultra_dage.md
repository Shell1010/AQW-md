With this boss you can't really heal with regular heals or HoT due to its decay debuff, you can if you time it but you risk killing your party. You can use Auras UI and monitor the decay debuff, but the window to heal is absolutely tiny. It is recommended to use health vamp here but if your class does a "lifesteal-esque" heal you will not need health vamp.


This boss as a ledgermayne like mechanic where there are two platforms, bottom left and right, and you are required to move to them immediately when they light up or face a nuke. Everytime dage kills a player he heals 500k HP, reset after 3 deaths.
