Honestly if you really wanted you could run mostly anything but there are spots like AP/LOO/LR that are that can't always be replaced, LOO and LR in particular. You can use any DPS also. There are no weird difficult mechanics but he has a counter attack so it is a good idea to hit esc when he starts the counter attack. Also make sure your useful skill doesn't get locked.

Destroy the defense drone first as it has a counter attack. You have an option to taunt the nuke but usually you kill him before that.

Boss drops your hp to 1 every 5%, LR can taunt here to prevent the party getting wiped. Alternatively can replace AP for something like SC/LH for more consistent heals, it's better to have more heals than
