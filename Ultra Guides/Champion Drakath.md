Probably slightly longer ultra on this list without a proper comp. Requires strict timing and some mana reduction classes. Every 2 million HP the boss sends out a nuke and gets stronger, it is recommended to taunt this so it hits 1 player instead of all 4 in the party. He also gets stronger each time he does the nuke so if a taunt is missed it is recommended to reset. It is not required to taunt on 10 million hp.

Alternatively CAV can be switched for DOT, or LR.
