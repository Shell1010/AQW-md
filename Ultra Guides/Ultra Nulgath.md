When killing the blade Nulgath gains a damage boost so it is preferred to not kill the blade too often, just right before he nukes the lobby would work. The blade nukes every 45 seconds so it is preferred for the DPS to focus on the blade if it is still not dead by 30 seconds.

| DoT   | Elysium/Wizard/Vainglory             | Sage/Malevolence Elixir + Potent Honor     | Role is to focus on blade. Alternatively you can leave it at 50% hp and wait for your AOE to kill it. |
| AP    | Valiance or Ravenous/Forge/Vainglory | Fate/Destruction Elixir + Scroll of Enrage | Role is to loop taunt nulgath with LOO.                                                               |

| LOO   | Awe Blast/Forge/Absolution           | Body/Divine Elixir + Potent Honor          | Just keep buffs up and focus nulgath.                                                                 |
