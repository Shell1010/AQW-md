You can always refer back to the [wiki](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/valencia-s-quests) but this guide should be concise enough for you.

This is another important grind for AQW as it is required for items like [[Awescended]] and forge enhancements. You can start the quests for Armour of Awe once you are Level 55 and have Rank 10 Blade of Awe Reputation. For levels please refer to [[Levelling Guide]]. Please refer to [[Faction Reputation Guides]] for Blade of Awe reputation.
