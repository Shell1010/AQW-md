AQW currently has 14 chronomancer’s as of creating this guide, and for a new player it can be pretty hard to learn what each chrono excels at and its drawbacks. This is not intended to be an in-depth guide, but I will go over pros and cons for each chronomancer in order to help you reach a conclusion.

## Chrono Shadowslayer/Shadowhunter

| Pros                                                                                                                                                              | Cons                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High DPS, can delete most bosses in 4 seconds or less                                                                                                             | To get the most out of your DPS, it usually runs Ravenous + Lament (requires forge)                                        |
| Great in Ultras due to it’s fast nuke cycle, nuke CD is 3 seconds at max haste                                                                                    | Dodge rotation usually requires a Felicitous Philtre to reach that 86.3% max dodge threshold, otherwise there is some RNG  |
| High base damage, it’s 4 skill does absurd amounts with ravenous even ignoring the nuke itself                                                                    | Gunslinger mode becomes viable when you can reach 8+ chaos rift stacks, otherwise it's better to use the regular rotation  |
| Has simple dodge rotation, killing one-shot bosses like the lich in /frozenlair                                                                                   | This does mean in order to fully **maximise** that DPS you’ll be limited by ping, but otherwise still great DPS            |
| Great single target farming class (think YnR or LEW), for high HP mobs you can simply spam 4 and get results (literally does everything wtf)                      | Requires learning how dodge rotation and gunslinger rotations work (this one less)                                         |
| Can get even **more** DPS by utilising gunslinger mode                                                                                                            | The difference between running potless and with just a felicitous philtre is large, so it’s recommended to run CSS with it |
| Scales primarily off LUK, the improvement to the class given by a single Felictous Philtre is massive, and greatly helps its consistency. It’s also REALLY cheap. |                                                                                                                            |
| Braindead base rotations that get you very good results (literaly 44444452), recommended by most players because of how stupid good it is                         |                                                                                                                            |

## Shadowstalker/Shadowwalker of Time

![[Pasted image 20250203030742.png]]

| Pros                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Infinite scaling nukes in a party, can be used to clear azalith in 3 minutes or less     | Requires potent honor potion in solo situations to get anywhere near 1.5 million nukes, otherwise you’re capped at 300k nukes     |
| Chainkilling bosses solo with 1.5 million HP within 7.5s                                 | 7.5s isn’t the fastest, there are chronos that can nuke faster and kill lower HP ranges <600k faster                              |
| Basically can kill any boss within a 7s threshold in a party after 2-4 kills ramp up     | Chainkilling requires having braincells, as it’s an active rotation with small amounts of rest, you need to manage nukes over 10s |
| Can clear azalith with minimal team supports, LR + LOO and you have a 3 minute run setup | In 7 man comps for azalith, it can do 1 minute clears, but there are faster options like TCM doing 46s clears.                    |
| Can farm to an extent due to its multi target moves with short-ish cooldowns             | Not a great farmer, a lot of classes will beat it                                                                                 |
| Provides team with max dodge due to its inbuilt taunt + dodge setup                      |                                                                                                                                   |
| Has dodge that is quite easy to use                                                      |                                                                                                                                   |

## Timeless/Corrupted Chronomancer

![[Pasted image 20250203154608.png]]

| Pros                                                                                       | Cons                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Has potential to have the highest DPS in the game, unmatched DPS                           | Transience Hourglass is perhaps the most complex in its usage, if you skill issue you will die                                       |
| Can kill bosses under 1 million HP in usually 1 shot, assuming correct setup can go higher | Some chronos can nuke bosses faster depending on the HP of the boss, example CMP or CSS                                              |
| Has versatility for a variety of situations due to its hourglasses. Tank, dodge, regular   | It’s other hourglasses are often overshadowed by transience because DPS means everything                                             |
| Complexity has very high rewards, if you like the challenge you will be rewarded           | Is somewhat inconsistent on crit, requires felicitous philtre to help reach consistency, it still nukes really high without critting |
| With forge and pots, you can do one of the fastest azalith clears assuming 7 man comp      | Transience requires penitence and dauntless to use effectively, otherwise it’s more difficult and the setup is usually not worth it  |
|                                                                                            | Not used in ultras generally, but can be                                                                                             |
|                                                                                            | Can be overwhelming to understand initially, due to its multiple hourglasses and effects                                             |

## Empyrean/Eternal/Immortal Chronomancer

![[Pasted image 20250203161655.png]]

| Pros                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has large nuke coefficient, naturally high nukes without pots or much setup | CDK generally nukes higher due to its modifier boost with minimal supports                                |
| Decent performance solo, has a HoT and some damage resists                  | Nuke cooldown is not the best, a lot of chronos like CSS, TCM, CMP can kill faster for majority HP ranges |
| Can clear Azalith faster than CDK in 7 man comps                            | Requires Dauntless + Lament to get the most out of it, buffing its crit chance and haste                  |
| Nuke cooldown is only 8s at max haste                                       | Functions okay with just Lament but nuke cycle is longer                                                  |
|                                                                             | Struggles to survive vs hard hitting bosses                                                               |

## Chronomancer Prime

![[Pasted image 20250203171918.png]]

| Pros                                                 | Cons                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Doesn’t require support, is sustainable solo         | Struggles to survive vs hard hitting bosses                                       |
| Can deal 300-400k nukes with guaranteed crit         | Outperformed by CSS due to its much faster nuke cooldowns and dps                 |
| Can be used for majority of farms, e.g Armour of Awe | Doesn’t have the highest nuke, and this can be an issue for bosses with higher HP |
| Low nuke cooldown, 6 seconds at max haste            |                                                                                   |
| Easy to reach its potential with minimal forge       |                                                                                   |
