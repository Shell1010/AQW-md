- Create the [Power Tonic](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/power-tonic) through the [/alchemy](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/alchemy-location) fehu merge.

Requires the skill to target an enemy to activate, whether it debuffs or is a damaging skill. It can only hit 1 target at a time and will always hit the current enemy selected, even if the skill hits multiple targets.

Provides some decent DPS and synergizes well with classes that have a similar cooldown on their 5th skill to 15 seconds. It also works with classes that have 5th skills with intervals of 5 or 3.

---
# Praxis

**Special skill on second skill:**
- 100% chance to activate on the second skill (4 second cooldown).
- Deals 70% Hybrid Damage, increasing +10% on each successive hit to the same target.
- Applies Spinning Dragon to the target for 2 seconds, reducing the next hit they do to 0.

| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------ |
| 100   | 50  | 50  | -   | -   | -   | 100 | 150,000 Gold |
| 90    | 45  | 45  | -   | -   | -   | 90  | 120,000 Gold |
| 80    | 40  | 40  | -   | -   | -   | 80  | 90,000 Gold  |
| 70    | 35  | 35  | -   | -   | -   | 69  | 70,000 Gold  |
| 60    | 30  | 30  | -   | -   | -   | 60  | 50,000 Gold  |

### Requirements
- Must have completed the [**"Defeat Jaaku!"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/ai-no-miko-s-quests#12) quest.
- Must be Level 60.
- Requires Rank 6 [[Faction Reputation Guides#Blacksmithing Reputation|Blacksmithing]].
- [Dragon Soul Shinob Armour](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragonsoul-shinobi-armor) from [/shadowfortress](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-fortress).
- [Imperial Chunin Clone](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/imperial-chunin-clone) from [/dragonkoiz](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragonkoi-z).
- [Dragon Rogue](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragon-rogue) from [/ectocave](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/ecto-cave).

- Complete the [**"Embracing Darkness**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dage-the-evil-s-quests#Yami) quest from [/darkally](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-ally) for 3x Yami.

Requires the skill to target an enemy to activate, whether it debuffs or is a damaging skill. It can only hit 1 target at a time and will always hit the current enemy selected, even if the skill hits multiple targets.

The two main uses for praxis are:
- Long fights for infinitely scaling damage
- Spinning Dragon as a "parry" for enemy attacks.

This basically means that praxis is used on classes that do not have a lot of dps outright so they can speed up long fights. It also holds some niche situations where the spinning dragon mechanic is desired.

Now we've finished the early weapon enhancements, and can begin doing the helmet enhancements.

# Vainglory

**Special passive trait:**
- +15% Damage Boost
- -50% Healing Intake

|Level|STR|INT|DEX|WIS|END|LUK|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|100|30|30|-|-|-|61|300,000 Gold|
|90|27|27|-|-|-|55|200,000 Gold|

### Requirements

- [Gauntlet Relic](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/gauntlet-relic)

Most classes can sustain themselves despite the healing penalty so it is mostly a common pick on everything. However, on certain bosses like nightbane or darkon who also reduce healing, the healing penalty from vainglory can cause you to start being damaged from heals. Using this enhancement with soul cleave/harbinger will allow you to have 0% healing intake.

# Penitence

**Special passive trait:**
- +25% Damage Resistance
- -25% DoT Boost

|Level|STR|INT|DEX|WIS|END|LUK|Cost|

- -5% Haste

It will benefit the class if the class has a low crit chance and doesn't suffer from the haste reduction.

Now with the completion of the cape enhancements you can start the endgame weapon forge enhancements. These are usually a lot more difficult, often have a large number of prerequisites or a long grind.

### Requirements
- Must have completed the '[The Final Challenge](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/mirror-drakath-s-quests#3)' quest.
- Must be Level 100.
- Requires Rank 10 [[Faction Reputation Guides#Blacksmithing Reputation|Blacksmithing]].

- [Drakath the Eternal](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/drakath-the-eternal).

- [Gravelyn's DoomFire Token](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/gravelyn-s-doomfire-token).
- [ArchPaladin Armor](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/archpaladin-armor).

Requires the skill to target an enemy to activate, whether it debuffs or is a damaging skill. It can only hit 1 target at a time and will always hit the current enemy selected, even if the skill hits multiple targets.

This is pretty much the generalist enhancement and can fit on all classes. This may be the best pick for some classes but generally the specialised enhancements may be superior on others.

### Requirements
- Must have completed the [[Awescended]] questline.

- [Blademaster Sword Scroll](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/blademaster-sword-scroll) from [/darkally](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-ally). Helps to have Rank 10 Blademaster or Swordmaster.
- [Archfiend Essence Fragment](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/archfiend-essence-fragment) from [Oblivion's Quests](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/oblivion-s-quests#1).

Requires the skill to target an enemy to activate, whether it debuffs or is a damaging skill. It can only hit 2 target at a time and will always hit the current enemy selected, and an extra one if you hit multi target. 

Since it is multi-target, it can be used on certain farming classes. Since it provides certain buffs on the user, it can be used on classes that have mana issues like shaman and improve their performance significantly.

This will trigger whether the skill does/doesn't do any damage. Seen as a support enhancement as it is basically awe blast but good (they both stack). Great for classes with fast auto attacks for extra DPS, for example against Void bosses.

Powerful enhancement that can make a lot of classes relevant and others even more powerful. Due to its buffs, it has great synergy with classes that deal self-damage and mostly physical skills. Even without it, due to its haste and crit chance allows it to improve a class in solo situations.

The enhancements below are going to be seen as optional and aren't really required, they're nice to have in niche scenarios though.

### Requirements
- Must have completed the '[Avatar of Fire](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/galanoth-s-quests#FireAvatar)' quest.
- Must be Level 80.
- Requires Rank 10 [[Faction Reputation Guides#Blacksmithing Reputation|Blacksmithing]].
- [Void Lodestone](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/void-lodestone)
- [Dark Potion](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-potion) x20
- [The Power of Darkness](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/the-power-of-darkness)
- [The Mortal Coil](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/the-mortal-coil)

Literally RNG and needs you to spend upto from 400 to 70k ACs depending on your luck with treasure chests. Have fun.

The 3 Skill has to target an enemy to activate, regardless of whether it’s a debuffing skill or a damaging skill.

It can hit up to 2 targets at a time, and it will hit the main enemy you have selected, and an extra one if your skill hits multiple targets.

Due to the Max HP based self DoT, most classes would die if Stygian is not allowed to fade, leading to the usage of Acheron feeling awkward. However, a main suggestion for a class to use Acheron with is Archmage, as it allows it to perform very well with minimal effort. While there are other classes that can use Acheron relatively viably, it is not notable enough to justifiably splurge on ACs just for the enhancement.
