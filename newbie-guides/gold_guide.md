Here are some locations to gather Gold fast for your quests or whatever. The upper thresholds of each farm can be possible with gold boosts and boosted items, or just being faster. Some of these methods are not effected by Gold boosts, for example selling bindings or vouchers.

With thanks to the following people for providing me with information:
- Milenius (Raidenexa)
- Csapasd
- Darkness2544 (Pizza Melt Ambassador)

An alternative way to passively gain gold is through your daily quests. 
- Doing [Sir Cole’s](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/sir-cole-s-quests) [/timeinn](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/inn-at-the-edge-of-time) daily ultra quests nets you 3.9 million gold at max boosts (750k with none)
- [Ultra Tyndarius quest](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/galanoth-s-quests#UltraTyn) grants an extra 1.3 million gold (250k with none)
- [Dage’s Champion Quests](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dage-the-evil-s-champion-quests) assuming you have the legion promotion item (easy to get) give a decent chunk of gold alongside legion tokens. This assumes you’re in legion.
