Not really any main prerequisites, just that you must be level 40 and by the final quest, level 80. This is an endgame class so you should have probably met that threshold by now.

Someone asked for this I don't remember who, felt like this was mostly self explanatory based on the quest description.

- **"Body, Soul and Domination"**
	- Join [/underrealm](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/under-realm) and defeat Fear till he drops 13x of his bones. May have to complete quests beforehand, it is a short map.

		- Whenever the enemy says "You cannot resist", you will have to use your vigil or you will die.
		- Alternatively, if you have chronos or someone can help you with chronos, you can nuke it as this boss doesn't have a shield.
	- Defeat Deadly Duo at [/infernalarena](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-arena).
		- It is a solo fight so you will not get help, you may need to do the previous fights.
		- Use archpaladin to reduce his outgoing damage and also reducing his lifesteal.
		- Alternatively, use scrolls of decay to stop him from healing.

	- The [Shadow Reaper of Doom](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadowreaper-of-doom) can be created from merging x300 Mirror Realm Tokens and 1x Undead Paladin Token.
		- Complete the [/mirrorportal] quest **"Good, Evil, and Chaos Battle"** for an easier time at getting mirror tokens.
		- Beat up Undead artix at [/overworld](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/overworld) till he drops his token, it is a 0.5% drop. Good luck lmao.
