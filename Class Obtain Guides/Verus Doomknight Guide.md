Not really any main prerequisites, just that you must be level 40 and by the final quest, level 80. This is an endgame class so you should have probably met that threshold by now.

Someone asked for this I don't remember who, felt like this was mostly self explanatory based on the quest description.

- **"Body, Soul and Domination"**
	- Join [/underrealm](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/under-realm) and defeat Fear till he drops 13x of his bones. May have to complete quests beforehand, it is a short map.
	- Head to [/brainmeat](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/brain-meat) and kill the brain matter for his drops.
