There aren't necessarily any prerequisites to start the quests but it is a good idea to have Rank 10 Good Reputation and the 13 Lord of Chaos saga completed, as this is needed for one of the quests. Please refer to the [[Faction Reputation Guides]] for information on how to reach Rank 10 Good.

If you are member or non-mem and had the Paladin class at one point you can skip a decent chunk of the grind. You just need it in your inventory with atleast 1 class point. You can skip to **"Commandment"** in the Guide if you have done so.

- **"A Strong Base"**
	- Get the Stone Paladin Armour from [/temple](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/temple-of-the-light). You will need to complete this questline if you haven't done so. The armour is available in the [shop](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/stone-paladin-armor-shop).
	- The Exalted Paladin Seal can be bought from the Mysterious Dungeon Rep shop from Artix, in [/darkthronehub](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/throne-of-darkness-hub). This requires Rank 10 Good Reputation.

- **"Proof of Valor"**
	- For x1000 Undead Energy you need to first have completed the quests in [/necropolis](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis) upto ["A Loyal Follower"](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/artix-s-quests#26). This will allow you to start gathering Undead Energy. You can obtain this resource the fastest at [/necrodungeon](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis-dungeon) from the 5 Headed Dracolich.
