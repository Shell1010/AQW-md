#tcm

This is the probably the most difficult hourglass to use with this class due to the fact it literally kills you if you suck. 

---
## Skills Overview

![[Pasted image 20240715151723.png]]

- **Corrupted Sand Strike - Auto Attack**
	- 100% Weapon Damage (Physical)
	- Short Range Attack
	- 2 second cooldown, 1 seconds at max haste
	- Single Target
	- **Infinite Corruption - TCM**
		- Applies Infinity Rend
		- DoT that stacks to 15
	- **Timepiece of Madness - UCM**
		- Applies Mad, increasing all out by 3%
		- At 5 Stacks of Mad applies Eternal
			- Increases critical chance by 80% and reduces all out by 30%

This is your auto attack which tends to do the most damage outside of your nuke, this will be what mainly feeds into your nukes recorded damage.

![[Pasted image 20240715152710.png]]
- **Sand Rift**
	- Hybrid Damage
	- Short Range Attack
	- 2.5 second cooldown, 1.25 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 15 mana
	- Single Target
	- Applies temporal rift, stacks to 4
		- Used as the nuke’s (5) inherent multiplier
			- 1 Stack = 0.5
			- 2 Stack = 0.7
			- 3 Stack = 1.0
			- 4 Stack and above = 1.5
		- The first temporal rift is used to start the damage recording over the most recent 10 seconds.
		- Consumed by Temporal Collapse (5)
	- **Hourglass of Transience**
		- If Stable, applies an increasing DoT on the enemy
		- Otherwise increases enemy all in by 8%

This skill is used to stack temporal rifts for your nuke as well as starting the recording for the damage feed into the nuke. It is meant to be used a lot so that you can stack your rifts for the eventual nuke.

---

![[Pasted image 20240715153911.png]]
- **Hourglass Inversion**
	- Hybrid Heal
	- Infinite Range Attack
	- 8 second cooldown, 4 seconds at max haste
	- Single Target
	- Heals based on the stacks of temporal rifts from your 2 skill, consumes rift stacks
	- **Infinite Corruption - TCM**
		- Applies HoT for 20 seconds
	- **Hourglass of Transience**
		- Removes ephemeral and transience
		- Applies Stable, increasing END and Haste by 50% for 10s

This skill is usually used after your nukes in order to heal, using the base class rotation. Or if you get hit hard you may have to just heal instead of nuking to avoid death. 

With infinite corruption it is useful to use this after your 4 to increase your all out and to make sure your HoT is squared. Refer to [[Stats & Misc#DoT/HoT Mechanics|DoT and HoT mechanics]] section.

---

![[Pasted image 20240715155040.png]]
- **Corruption Through Time**
	- Hybrid Status Skill
	- Long Range Attack
	- 6 second cooldown, 3 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 20 mana
	- Single target
	- Applies corruption through time, 20% increase to all out
	- **Entropic Corruption - TCM**
		- Entropic Harm, increases all in to yourself by +150%
		- Entropic Mana, increases haste by 30%, reduces mana costs by -50%
		- Entropic Power, increases all out by 100%
		- Focus for 3 seconds, enemy attacks you
	- **Foresee Corruption - TCM**
		- Applies Foresee for 150 seconds
		- Using **Foresee Corruption** again, replaces Foresee with Seer for 20 seconds
		- Using Corruption Through Time (4) again, replaces Seer with Change the Future. This applies the following for 5 seconds:
			- Decrease your all in by 80%
			- increasing dodge, haste, hit chance, damage, and crit damaage by 100%
	- **Timepiece of Madness - UCM**
		- Applies Potential for 20 seconds. Increases your hit chance by 20% for 20 seconds. This aura has a CD of 20 seconds.
	- **Timepiece of Inevitability - UCM**
		- Applies Inevitable Corruption. Increases all out and haste by 12% for 20 seconds
		- Using **Timepiece of Inevitability** again while Inevitable Corruption is active applies Snap to the enemy. Deals high damage after a short delay.
	- **Timepiece of Pestilence - UCM**
		- Applies Infectious Air, decreasing enemy all in by -20% for 10 seconds, stacks to 3, consumed by Temporal Collapse (5).

	- **Hourglass of Transience**
		- Applies Transient on yourself, a growing DoT over 20 seconds
		- Using 4 again applies Ephemeral, granting 50% dodge and 50% all out


This skill is usually what you start every rotation with due to the buffs it applies. It also activates majority of the consumables buffs/debuffs so it is integral to the use of the class.

![[Pasted image 20240715162104.png]]
- **Temporal Collapse**
	- Magical Damage
	- Short Range Attack
	- 15 second cooldown, 7.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 35 mana
	- Single target
	- Deals damage based on the amount of rifts stacked from your 2 skill and the recorded damage in the most recent 10 seconds

Used to just nuke hit hard and big boom. Use once you have 4 rifts, though it is okay to use it with 3 stacks as it also provides decent ish damage.

## Consumables

While I have specified what the non hourglass consumables do in each skill, here I’ll reiterate and explain the general use for each consumable.

---
### Hourglass of Transience

![[Pasted image 20240715202610.png]]
- While this is acitve, it applies the following:
	- Corruption Through Time (4) applies Transient, a growing DoT for 20s.
		- Using 4 again while Transient is active also applies ephemeral, increasing dodge and all out by 50% for 5s
	- Using Hourglass Inversion (3) removes Transient and Ephemeral
	- Applies Incorporeal
		- Increases END & Haste by 50% for 10s
	- Applies Stable
		- While Stable, Sand Rift (2) applies a growing DoT for 8s
	- While Transient, Sand Rift (2) applies flow, increases enemy all in by 8%, stacks to 3

This pretty much gives you enough dodge to pass the 86.3% dodge threshold required for full dodge. It allows you to solo hard hitting bosses while also dishing out pretty considerable damage during this state. The only risk is that you basically have a timer on yourself 24/7 so failing to cleanse the debuff in time may lead to death.

---
### Entropic Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715181254.png]]
- When using 4 while active, applies the following:
	- Entropic Mana: Increase Mana reduction by 50%, Haste by 30%
	- Entropic Harm: Increases all in to self by 150%
	- Entropic Power: Increases all out by 100%

Big damage, big risks, great in parties due to boost scaling. Often used alongside Hourglass of Power.

---
### Infinite Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715182306.png]]
- While this is active it applies the following:
	- Auto Attack applies a DoT that stacks to 15 and lasts 40 seconds
	- Hourglass Inversion (3) applies a HoT for 20 seconds

Often used with Hourglassof Transience if you do not have dauntless. Due to the fact the HoT output is kinda low ish, it is recommended to square the output. So utilise Corruption Through Time’s (4) 20% all out buff and then apply the HoT.

---
### Foresee Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715182701.png]]
- While this is active, using Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- The initial use of 4 applies Foresee for 150 seconds
	- Using the consumable (6) again while Foresee is active will then replace it with Seer
	- While Seer is active using Corruption Through Time (4) again will apply Change the Future
		- This reduces all in by 80%
		- 100% Dodge, Haste, Hit chance, Crit Damage, and all out increase
		- Taunt

Generally this allows a slow but large nuke, but it is often much better to use the other consumables due to the slow overall dps. This only procs every 40 or so seconds.

---
### Timepiece of Inevitability

![[Pasted image 20240715183833.png]]
- While this is active, using Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- Applies Inevitable Corruption, Increases your all out and haste by 12% for 20 seconds
	- Using the consumable (6) while this is active applies Snap, dealing high damage after a short delay

I can’t account for the playstyle or use cases myself for the timepieces, the information below is based on SLGMA’s guide.

Refer to his guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHEYDB5JM2qSBFYwVs6Hkj17x24TElB1mtuQUyidv18/edit).

Used with Hourglass of Power + Inevitability due to the extra damage feeded in from snap. For overall higher nukes. There is a complex Hourglass of Transcience rotation with this also.

---
### Timepiece of Madness

![[Pasted image 20240715185417.png]]
- While this is active it applies the following:
	- Auto Attack applies Mad, increasing all out by 3%
		- Once at 5 stacks of Mad, you become eternal
		- Increasing Critical Chance by 80% and decreasing all out by 30%
	- Corruption Through Time (4) applies Potential, increasing hit chance by 20% for seconds

With Hourglass of Power + Madness, the idea is to line up your nukes with the 5 stacks of Mad to deal big funny numbers. There is a Transcience + Madness rotation but you are required to manage your HP well to avoid accidentally dying.

---
### Timepiece of Pestilence

![[Pasted image 20240715190314.png]]
- While this is active, Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- Infectious Air, increasing damage takes by 20% and stacks to 3 and lasts 10 seconds. Is consumed by Temporal Collapse (5).
	- All In is increased by 100% for 10 seconds
	- Applies a light DoT to your opponent
	- Applies Decay to your opponent

General idea with this timepeice is to gather stacks while nuking. This reduces your own defense so it can be quite risky.

## Enhancements

| Situation          | Enhancements                         | Rating | Extra Information                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Solo               | Dauntless/Anima/Penitence            | 10/10  | Great for damage, it feels like dauntless is MADE for transience. |
| Solo (alternative) | Lacerate or Valiance/Anima/Penitence | 8/10   | Some extra dodge outside of ephemeral                             |

There are no farming alternatives here, if you’re ever going to farm with this class you’re going to farm a boss to which you’d use either example above. Don’t use this to farm mobs.

## Gameplay/Combos

So due to the fact transcience literally can kill you at any time we recommend having penitence for this class. This is because without it, you’re gonna die faster, and penitence will reduce the self DoT by a decent amount so you don’t die as fast! 

Generally the rotation is the same as before. However, you have a choice to prestack ephemeral. This is because you don’t initially have the full 100% dodge when you enter 4, you need to hit 4 twice for the ephemeral aura to apply. Make sure that once you have ephemeral, always end it by 4-3 instead of 2-3 as the latter will eat your ephemeral and you will have to prestack again (hit 4 twice).

The idea is to time your 5 and 3 for when you dodge so that you can quickly use 4 again and re-enter max dodge state. Don’t spend too long without using 3, you will die. 

4-2-4-3 (Prestack)
4-2-2-4-2-2-5-3

### Entropic Corruption

In a normal situation, you will die very very fast using this. But this is mostly for a really niche situation that can work, the only issue is that you are required to do this preparation each time, so realistically this is only usable for situations where you need to kill something for long periods of time in a safe and easy manner.

Join a duel with an archpaladin and have them use your 4 skill (Righteous Seal) on you, then apply 4 and join the map with the boss you intend to kill. You will find that the DoT on yourself is instead an increasing HoT. 

This means you will have 100% dodge with a large HoT, great for situations where you want to be braindead. The main issue is obviously the preparation, utilise the combo below and make sure you never use 3.

4-2-4 (prestack)
4-2-2-4-2-2-5

### Infinite Corruption

This is the corruption that works best with the class without dauntless, it provides a decent HoT that’s used for extra survivability. It can be improved with squaring but our default combo above accounts for that.

4-2-4-3 (prestack)
4-2-2-4-2-2-5-3

Foresee will pretty much kill you before you even get a nuke off, use any other pots if you don’t want to use the above two. Feli + Dauntless Transience is a great match.

## Extra Information

Refer to the [[Stats & Misc#Chronos and their weird intricacies|Chrono Section]] for the Stats & Misc area for general information, this will be specified for TCM. This section is to tell you how to optimise damage with TCM, I will go over the base class in this section as well as under the effects of particular consumables if they effect the class nukes in any way.

Chronos like TCM are literally funny number machine due to the fact they utilise so many buffs together the damage for nukes is exponential. Utilising pots and 

The base class takes in the following buffs into the nuke:
- All Out
- Mag Out
- Crit Modifier

TCM’s coefficient is 1.3

Rifts multiplier stacks like this:
- 1 Stack = 0.5
- 2 Stack = 0.7
- 3 Stack = 1.0
- 4 Stack and above = 1.5

The base mag out for TCM is at 32% so 1.32

The base crit mod for TCM is at 260% so 2.6

You’re running Hourglass of Transience so you’re going to be working with an extra all out 50% from Ephemeral (applying 4 twice) and 20% from Corruption Through Time (4). So 70% all out total.

So our final equation looks like this (this assumes you crit)

$$
RecordedDamageMod = RiftMulti \times Coefficient \times AllOutBuffs \times MagOutBuffs \times CritMod
$$

With the base class this will be at 4 rifts:

`1.5 (4 rifts) x 1.3 (coefficient) x 1.7 (all out buffs) x 1.32 (mag out buffs) x 2.6 (crit mod buffs) = 11.37708`

Damage done during the most recent 10 seconds from the first temporal rift applying, will then be multiplied by the value above at 4 rifts, assuming you are using transience.

This is the upper threshold for the damage multiplier without the use of corruptions/pots, however you can shorten your nuke cycles should the boss have less hp, to avoid overkilling. Non-crits are in brackets.
- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 11.38 (4.38)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 7.58 (2.92)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 5.31 (2.04)
- 1 Rifts (0.5) - 3.79 (1.46)

Below are the differences with different corruptions/pots.

**Entropic Corruption**
This is usually suicide but if you manage to do the stupid preparation with this it gives 100% all out and some extra haste to feed in more damage. Total all out will become 170%.

The reason this works is because AP would end up reducing your all out by 105% (for the DoT), so -5% all out. The all out buff is then squared because it is a DoT (-0.05 x -0.05) to reach 0.025% all out. Refer to [[Stats & Misc#DoT/HoT Mechanics|DoT and HoT mechanics]] section for an explanation on squaring.

Since Corruption Through Time applies a 20% buff after the initial transience DoT, it’s added to reach a 15% all out buff (20 + -5). The transience aura profile is considered to be a non-overtakeable aura, meaning the aura timer will refresh when reapplied, but it will not force a recalculation. So because the aura snapshotted a negative all out for the base damage calculation the final all out buff will end up being negative. -0.05 x 0.15 = -0.0075 (0.75% all out) which is used for the DoT.

This however, doesn’t effect your later damage for nukes or skills, as the auras for righteous seal fades and you will have your full damage for nukes after they fade. You need to make sure you do not use your 3 skill to avoid the transience aura fading.

- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 18.07 (6.95)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 12.05 (4.63)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 8.43 (3.24)
- 1 Rift (0.5) - 6.02 (2.32)

**Felicitous Philtre**
A potion that grants 50% more luck, pretty great on this chrono due to the fact it applies to the damage you feed in and the actual nuke too. Numbers may vary but should be around the same.

Recommended to use with dauntless or some other form of recovery since this will take a slot.
![[Pasted image 20240717012630.png]]
This leads to a 315% crit mod, a boost in other areas but they don’t necessarily apply to our nuke.
- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 13.78 (4.38)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 7.58 (2.92)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 5.31 (2.04)
- 1 Rifts (0.5) - 3.79 (1.46)
