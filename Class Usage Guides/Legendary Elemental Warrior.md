This class is pretty simple to obtain, you can get it from [/curio](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/curiosities) for 2400 ACs (buying each orb) or with membership you can farm each of the reputations associated with each orb.

This class is a decent DPS soloer with great single target farming capabilities due to its high damage output. It is incredibly unique in terms of how it behaves, you are required to utilise different skill combos for different effects.

## Enhancements

Please refer to the [[Basic Class Guide]] for LEW enhancements without forge, this section will just outline some situations where it may do better in. The most important thing is to adapt accordingly, read the room and make sure you aren't stubborn when changing up enhancements.

| Situation | Enhancements                                   | Rating | Extra Information                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Farming   | Valiance or Dauntless/Vim/Avarice or Vainglory | 8/10   | In 2 mob rooms like sevencircleswar you can farm very quickly. |
| Solo      | Dauntless/Anima/Vainglory                      | 7/10   | Not the best dps and there are better alternatives.            |

## Gameplay/Combos

So this class is pretty simple to use, there are elemental "combos" that can cause different effects and you pretty much have free roam over this. Generally you are to start with 2 and pick two elements depending on your situation. The order of the elements matter.

253 - Crit Chance + Crit Dmg
235 - Outgoing dmg
234 - Damage reduction
243 - Increase to END and Healing Intake
254 - HoT
245 - Haste

There isn't necessarily a stable combo but I'd start with
253234 and pick and choose as you go.
