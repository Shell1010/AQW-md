Guide to obtain [[Verus Doomknight Guide|Verus Doomknight here]] if you don't already have it.

Verus doomknight is an incredible simple class and takes the role of DPS/DPS Support thanks to its amazing debuffs.

It is recommended to use the Auras UI [[Newbie Guide#Advanced Options|advanced option]] as you will be able to visibly see how many stacks you have at once.

- **Necrotic Blade - Auto Attack**
	- Physical Damage
	- Short Range Attack
	- 2 second cooldown, 1 second at max haste
	- Single target
	- Applies weakened with every strike, weakening the target's outgoing damage by 15% for 20 seconds.
		- This pretty much never goes out, stays for the entirety of the fight.

A very useful auto attack, can make VDK survive some decently hard hitting monsters, for example the Level 90 hydras at [/hydrachallenge](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/hydra-challenge).

- **Soul Fracture**
	- 85% Magical Damage
	- Long Range Attack
	- 5 seconds cooldown, 2.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 5 mana
	- Single target
	- Base effect is that it applies fractured soul, reducing their damage resistance by 50% and physical and magical resistance by an extra 30%. A total of 80% damage reduction for 8 seconds.
	- If Unleashed Doom(5 skill buff) is active, reduces for an additional 30% for 5 seconds.
	- If Darkness Gathered (5 skill stack), increases Crit chance by 20% and Crit damage by 50% for seconds

This skill is usually what you start a fight with, as it reduces their defenses, this being where most of you and your party's DPS comes from. When your 5 skill is active this can further decrease their damage resistance to 110%.

Generally a good idea to use your Darkness Gathered stack on this skill as it increases your crit damage by 50% and crit chance by 20%.

- **Life Carve**
	- 95% Physical Damage
	- Long Range Attack
	- 5 seconds cooldown, 2.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 5 mana
	- Single Target
	- Does some lifesteal, stealing slightly less than half hp.
	- Applies a DoT for 6 seconds
	- If Unleashed Doom (5 Skill Buff) is active, HoT active for 5 seconds named Necrotic Warmth.
	- If Darkness Gathered (5 Skill stack), increases damage resistance by 50% for 20 seconds, called Veil of Darkness.

This skill is your healing skill, pretty self explanatory.

It can be situational to use your darkness gathered stack on this skill as it provides very high damage resistance, can be useful with fighting harder hitting mobs.

- **Unleash Doom**
	- 120% Magical Damage
	- Long range Attack
	- 10 seconds cooldown, 5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 8 mana
	- Single Target
	- Inflicts decay for 3 seconds
	- If you have 10 stacks of doom, they are all used to apply Unleashed Doom.
		- If Unleashed Doom is applied or this skill is used again while active, you get a stack of Gathered Darkness

This skill is generally used to enter into the Unleashed doom state to get even more debuffs out and additional dps. It's pretty much what this class is centered around.

## Gameplay/Combos

Very braindead to play, pretty much get stacks of doom from using your skill and activate 5, use your skills on cooldown.

You get a gather darkness stack from using 5 while in unleashed doom or initiating unleashed doom.


2345 234 2345 234 ...

Depending on the situation you can change what you use the Gather Darkness stack on, for example if you want extra defense, use it on 3.
