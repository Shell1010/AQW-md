Possibly one of the easiest chronos to use with great overall output. Short nuke cycles with high damage, good for majority of game content, making it a great first pick chronomancer.

Thank you to the following people for providing me with information:

## Skills Overview

![[Pasted image 20240728172830.png]]
- **Temporal Strike**
	- 60% Hybrid Damage / 0.6 APSP2
	- Short Range Attack
	- 1.5 second cooldown, 0.75 at max haste
	- Single target
	- Stacks temporal rift with each strike
	- Used as the nuke's inherent multiplier
		- 1 Stack = 0.5
		- 2 Stack = 0.7
		- 3 Stack = 1.0
		- 4 Stack and above = 1.5
	- The first temporal rift is used to start the damage recording over the most recent 10 seconds.

Short cooldowns, so spam this for stacking rifts quickly. Used to also start the recording for your damage feeds into the nuke. 

Manage the amount of rifts you use depending on the HP of the enemy.

| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Damage               | Dauntless/Anima/Vainglory | 9/10   | Fast haste, utilise 5 to make sure you donâ€™t miss. Drop 3 due to already fat haste buff.     |
| Damage (alternative) | Lacerate/Anima/Vainglory  | 8/10   | Due to lacerate decreasing enemy dodge, you donâ€™t need to use 5. Utilise 3 for a haste buff. |

## Gameplay/Combos

Due to the simplicity of the skills the class doesnâ€™t necessarily require you to do much. You just need to know when to use either 5 or 3. You should also manage the amount of stacks of temporal rift you have, as sometimes the boss doesnâ€™t require you to stack to 4 due to itâ€™s lack of HP.

When using dauntless or having supports:
- Avoid using 3 due to the fact you have a haste buff
- 5 2 2 2 2 4
- Reduce the amount of 2 if needed

When using lacerate:
- Optional use of 5 due to the fact it already reduces dodge. But adds some DoT damage.
- (5) 3 2 2 2 2 4
- Reduce the amount of 2 if needed

You can stack upto 7 rifts before the nuke feed reaches 10 seconds.

## Extra Information

I donâ€™t have the class myself so thereâ€™s no practical testing.

CMPâ€™s Coefficient is 1

The nuke takes the following outgoing modifiers into the nuke:
- All Out
- Mag Out
- Phy Out
- Crit Modifier

Rifts multiplier stacks like this:
- 1 Stack = 0.5
- 2 Stack = 0.7
- 3 Stack = 1.0
- 4 Stack and above = 1.5

Final equation for the nuke multiplier would be this.

$$
RecordedDamaageMod = RiftMulti \times Coefficient \times AllOut \times MagOut \times PhyOut \times CritMod
$$
