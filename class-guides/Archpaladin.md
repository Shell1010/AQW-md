Guide to obtain [[Archpaladin Guide|archpaladin here]] if you don't have it. 

Archpaladin (AP) is incredibly simple to use and takes the role of support/defensive tank. In ultras it is used in almost every comp in pubs. It also does extra damage against undead.

It is recommended to use Auras UI in the [[Newbie Guide#Advanced Options|advanced options]] when using this class as you will be able to better track the Auras for Righteous Seal and Broken Seal.

## Skills Overview

![[Pasted image 20240608192240.png]]
- **Commandment**
	- 135% Hybrid Damage / 1.5 EX1
	- Long Range Attack
	- 5 second cooldown, 2.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 10 mana
	- Hits 3 targets (AOE)
	- Applies three debuffs, Divine, Commandent, and Eminent
		- Divine reduces enemy Dodge by 10% per stack, stacks upto 6
		- Commandent reduces enemy Defense by 10% per stack, stacks upto 6
		- Eminent reduces enemy Hit Chance, Outgoing Damage, and Crit chance by 5% per stack, stacks upto 6
	- Each of these debuff auras last 6 seconds
	- Does Extra damage to undead

This skill is mainly going to be spammed inbetween your other skills' cooldown, provides up 60% dodge reduction, 60% defense reduction, and 30% hit chance, damage and crit chance reduction at max stacks. It is also a decent way of getting back your mana.

There is a misconception that these stacks disappear whenever you use your 5 skill, however this is before the Archpaladin rework. This no longer applies now and you are able to use your 5 skill without effecting these stacks.

- **Hymn of Light**
	- 660% Hybrid Heal (been reduced by an unknown amount in design notes) / -3.8 APSP1
	- Long Range Skill
	- 10 second cooldown, 5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 40 mana
	- Heals 7 allies (AOE)
	- Heals a large amount of health, always crits
	- Grants 20% Defense and Endurance for 15 seconds.


This skill is mainly used before starting a fight, granting you and your allies a 20% Endurance and Defense buff. During the fight you'd use this when you need to heal, pretty self explanatory.

- **Righteous Seal**
	- 135% Hybrid / 1.35 APSP2
	- Long Range Attack
	- 25 second cooldown, 12.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 20 mana
	- Single Target
	- Stuns Target for 3 seconds if undead
	- Applies Righteous Seal, decreasing the enemies Outgoing Damage by 90% and lasts 7 seconds.

This skill is core to archpaladin gameplay, it is the main source of damage reduction. For some specific fights you may be required to time your usage of 4 skill to reduce damage from the bosses nukes. 

In the past you were able to easily loop this skill before the archpaladin rework, this is no longer possible as aura lasts 7 seconds and the cooldown is at fastest 12.5 seconds.

- **Sacred Magic: Eden**
	- 475% Hybrid Damage / 5.5 Pyro1
	- Long Range Attack
	- 25 second cooldown, 12.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 40 mana
	- Hits 3 targets (AOE)
	- Deals massive damage
	- If Righteous Seal (4 Skill Buff) is still active, you do double damage
		- This applies a buff called Broken Seal
		- Reduces enemy Outgoing Damage by 15% and stacks to 2
		- Lasts for 25 seconds

Pretty much the only time you'd ever use this skill is while Righteous Seal (4 Skill debuff) is about to end. This is so you can deal some crazy damage and also maintain a 15% (max 30%) Outgoing Damage reduction on the enemy from the Broken Seal debuff. This righteous seal is loopable and even stacks with your 4 Skill Debuff equating to even more Outgoing Damage reduction.

**THIS DOESN'T EAT YOUR 2 SKILL STACKS ANYMORE. STOP.**

## Enhancements

You can take a look at [[Basic Class Guide]] for a general enhancement overview for Archpaladin if you do not have forges. But in this guide I'll try to specifiy some different enhancement variations where AP may work better in specific situations. The most important thing is to adapt accordingly, read the room and make sure you aren't stubborn when changing up enhancements.

| Situation                  | Enhancements                                    | Rating | Extra Information                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Farming                    | Valiance or Lacerate/Vim/Avarice                | 4/10   | I mean there could be worse.                                                               |
| Solo (3k DMG Boss)         | Smite or Valiance/Forge/Vainglory or Penitence  | 6/10   | DPS wasn't too good but provides great defensive buffs. Really hard to die as archpaladin. |
| Solo (Attempt at High DPS) | Valiance/Anima/Vainglory or Lament              | 6/10   | Slightly better, less survivability.                                                       |
| Party                      | Valiance or Arcana/Forge/Vainglory or Penitence | 8/10   | Provides great party supports, integral in ultras like champion drakath, ultra malgor.     |
| Champion Drakath           | Lacerate/Forge/Penitence                        | 8/10   | Can also swap for Awe Blast or Arcana's Concerto as you are a support.                     |

## Gameplay/Combos

So this class is pretty braindead, there aren't necessarily anything you need to manage other than making sure you use 5 right before 4 is about to end.

- Use 3 before the start of the fight
- Use 4 as your first skill
- Spam 2 till 4 buff is about to end
- Hit 5 when 4 is about to end
- Use 3 when you need to heal
- Hit 4 again when no longer on cooldown and repeat
