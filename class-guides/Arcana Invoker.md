Guide to obtain it [[Arcana Invoker Guide|here]] if you don't already have it.

Arcana Invoker (AI) is a great generalist, its main strengths are DPS and Farming and has some ultra usage though isn't necessarily meta in any role. The class is unique in the way the buffs/debuffs apply, however once reaching "The World" it just becomes a spam fest.

It is recommended to use Auras UI in the [[Newbie Guide#Advanced Options|advanced options]] since you will need to track how long you have left in "The World".

		- Changes effects of other skills
	- If "The World" is active, deals damage based on your stacks of "End of the World" (3 while in "The World")
		- This also resets it, meaning you start again at "The Fool"
	- Using this while "Judgement" not active will cause the cycle to reset (Goes back to "The Fool")

This skill is mainly going to be used at the very start of your fights so you can start the cycle. This will allow you to cycle through your other acana's using the 3 skill so it is important that this skill is the first one you use. You won't touch this skill again till you've reached "The World" and also when the aura is about to end.

When "The World" is about to end, you can use this again to reset the cycle and gain some extra damage.

	- 100% Hybrid Damage / 1 Spell1
	- Infinite Range Attack
	- 3 second cooldown, 1.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 0 mana
	- Single target
	- If "The Fool" is active, summons an arcana. They are summoned in this particular order and they each have different effects:
		- 1 - Magician: 22% INT  
		- 2 - High Priestess: 22% WIS
		- 3 - Empress: HoT  
		- 4 - Emperor: 22% outgoing damage  
		- 5 - Hierophant: 22% Heal Power  
		- 6 - Lovers: 22% END  
		- 7 - Chariot: 22% Haste  
		- 8 - Justice: 22% Phys and Mag damage  
		- 9 - Hermit: 22% Dodge  
		- 10 - Wheel of Fortune: 22% LUCK  
		- 11 - Strength: 22% STR  
		- 12 - Hanged Man: 22% DEX  
		- 13 - Death: 22% Crit Damage  
		- 14 - Temperance: Enhanced HoT  
		- 15 - Devil: 22% Crit Chance  
		- 16 - Tower: 22% Phys and Mag Resist  
		- 17 - Star: MoT  
		- 18 - Moon: -22% Mana Costs  
		- 19 - Sun: 22% Hit Chance  
		- 20 -Judgement: Awakens The World
	- If "The World" is active, applied a stack of "End of the World" instead for 8 seconds.
		- Increases damage of this skill
		- Reduces your damage resistance by 4% per stack

You will be trying to spam this skill as much as possible in order to get through the initial arcanas and get to "Judgement". Once reaching "Judgement" you use the 2 skill and enter "The World".

In "The World" this skill will be a significant part of your DPS, alongside the 5 skill. However, due to the damage resistance fall off, you can go into negatives quite quickly. 

Each arcana has the same effects of the previously summoned arcana, even though the auras are replaced. So Arcana 8 (Justice) will have the effects of the previously summoned arcana 1-7 and itself.

	- Infinite Range Attack
	- - 3 second cooldown, 1.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 40 mana
	- Hits 2 targets (AOE)
	- If "The Fool" is active, applies a reversed arcana on the enemy. They are summoned according to what arcana you are on and they have these effects:
		- 0 - Fool: -22% Damage Resist  
		- 1 - Magician: -22% damage

		- 17 - Star: -22% DoT Resist  
		- 18 - Moon: -22% Haste  
		- 19 - Sun: -22% Hit Chance
	- If "Judgement" is active, applies one time bonus damage on the target
	- If "The World" is active, applies "The World (reversed)" for 5 seconds, applying all the stat debuffs listed here at half potency, can't miss.

The idea with this skill is to time your 4 usage for the particular debuffs you want to inflict on the opponent. For example, if you are on the 3rd arcana with your 3 skill, and then use your 4 skill to apply a reversed arcana, you cause a DoT. 

In this way you can prioritise some specific arcana's for damage or survivability. For example for damage: 0, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20. Using 4 at these points will help you deal optimised damage.

The impact to DPS from just mindlessly spamming vs the above isn't too different, so this is only recommended if you want to do specific strategies (example Dodge).

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Farming/Soloing | Elysium or Ravenous/Pneuma/Vainglory or Lament  | 10/10  | Best in class DPS, and elysium helps manage mana.                                   |
| Soloing         | Valiance or Ravenous/Pneuma/Vainglory or Lament | 9/10   | Alternative to Elysium for more damage, though more restrictive due to mana issues. |

## Gameplay/Combos

There isn't necessarily a "combo" per say for this class. Your main priority should be getting into "The World" and getting off majority of your damage there.

Start off the cycle with 2.
Prioritise your 3 skill so that you can reach judgement faster.
Try to use 4 or 5 inbetween when 3 is in cooldown.

Alternatively, use 4 at these arcanas to prioritise damage: 
- 0
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 13
- 14
- 16
- 17
- 20

Or, use 4 at these arcanas to prioritise survivability:
- 1
- 8
- 10
- 11
- 15
- 19

Once reaching "Judgement" activate "The World" by hitting 2 again.

During the world pretty much spam 3-4-5, however make sure to look out for "The World" aura running out, when it is about to finish hit 2 and restart the cycle again.
