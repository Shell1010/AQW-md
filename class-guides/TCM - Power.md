In terms of usage, this is possibly the easiest to use of the hourglasses, just some nice buffs with a slight reduction to your defence.

## Skills Overview

![[Pasted image 20240715151723.png]]

- **Corrupted Sand Strike - Auto Attack**
	- 100% Weapon Damage (Physical)
	- Short Range Attack
	- 2 second cooldown, 1 seconds at max haste
	- Single Target
	- **Infinite Corruption - TCM**
		- Applies Infinity Rend
		- DoT that stacks to 15
	- **Timepiece of Madness - UCM**
		- Applies Mad, increasing all out by 3%
		- At 5 Stacks of Mad applies Eternal
			- Increases critical chance by 80% and reduces all out by 30%

This is your auto attack which tends to do the most damage outside of your nuke, this will be what mainly feeds into your nukes recorded damage.

![[Pasted image 20240715152710.png]]
- **Sand Rift**
	- Hybrid Damage
	- Short Range Attack
	- 2.5 second cooldown, 1.25 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 15 mana
	- Single Target
	- Applies temporal rift, stacks to 4
		- Used as the nuke’s (5) inherent multiplier
			- 1 Stack = 0.5
			- 2 Stack = 0.7
			- 3 Stack = 1.0
			- 4 Stack and above = 1.5
		- The first temporal rift is used to start the damage recording over the most recent 10 seconds.
		- Consumed by Temporal Collapse (5)

This skill is used to stack temporal rifts for your nuke as well as starting the recording for the damage feed into the nuke. It is meant to be used a lot so that you can stack your rifts for the eventual nuke.

![[Pasted image 20240715153911.png]]
- **Hourglass Inversion**
	- Hybrid Heal
	- Infinite Range Attack
	- 8 second cooldown, 4 seconds at max haste
	- Single Target
	- Heals based on the stacks of temporal rifts from your 2 skill, consumes rift stacks
	- **Infinite Corruption - TCM**
		- Applies HoT for 20 seconds
	- **Hourglass of Power**
		- Applies Power for 30 seconds
		- Increases all out, Haste, Crit chance, Crit Damage, Hit Chance, Dodge Chance by 10%
		- Reduces all in by 10%

This skill is usually used after your nukes in order to heal, using the base class rotation. Or if you get hit hard you may have to just heal instead of nuking to avoid death. 

With infinite corruption it is useful to use this after your 4 to increase your all out and to make sure your HoT is squared. Refer to [[Stats & Misc#DoT/HoT Mechanics|DoT and HoT mechanics]] section.

			- increasing dodge, haste, hit chance, damage, and crit damaage by 100%
	- **Timepiece of Madness - UCM**
		- Applies Potential for 20 seconds. Increases your hit chance by 20% for 20 seconds. This aura has a CD of 20 seconds.
	- **Timepiece of Inevitability - UCM**

![[Pasted image 20240715162104.png]]
- **Temporal Collapse**
	- Magical Damage
	- Short Range Attack
	- 15 second cooldown, 7.5 seconds at max haste
	- Uses 35 mana
	- Single target
	- Deals damage based on the amount of rifts stacked from your 2 skill and the recorded damage in the most recent 10 seconds

Used to just nuke hit hard and big boom. Use once you have 4 rifts, though it is okay to use it with 3 stacks as it also provides decent ish damage.

## Consumables

While I have specified what the non hourglass consumables do in each skill, here I’ll reiterate and explain the general use for each consumable.
### Hourglass of Power

![[Pasted image 20240715194349.png]]
- When using 3 while this is active, applies the following:
	- Applies Power for 30 seconds
	- Increases all out, Haste, Crit chance, Crit Damage, Hit Chance, Dodge Chance by 10%
	- Reduces all in by 10%


---
### Entropic Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715181254.png]]
- When using 4 while active, applies the following:
	- Entropic Mana: Increase Mana reduction by 50%, Haste by 30%
	- Entropic Harm: Increases all in to self by 150%
	- Entropic Power: Increases all out by 100%

Big damage, big risks, great in parties due to boost scaling. Often used alongside Hourglass of Power.

---
### Infinite Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715182306.png]]
- While this is active it applies the following:
	- Auto Attack applies a DoT that stacks to 15 and lasts 40 seconds
	- Hourglass Inversion (3) applies a HoT for 20 seconds

Often used with Hourglassof Transience if you do not have dauntless. Due to the fact the HoT output is kinda low ish, it is recommended to square the output. So utilise Corruption Through Time’s (4) 20% all out buff and then apply the HoT.

---
### Foresee Corruption

![[Pasted image 20240715182701.png]]
- While this is active, using Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- The initial use of 4 applies Foresee for 150 seconds
	- Using the consumable (6) again while Foresee is active will then replace it with Seer
	- While Seer is active using Corruption Through Time (4) again will apply Change the Future
		- This reduces all in by 80%
		- 100% Dodge, Haste, Hit chance, Crit Damage, and all out increase
		- Taunt

Generally this allows a slow but large nuke, but it is often much better to use the other consumables due to the slow overall dps. This only procs every 40 or so seconds.

---
### Timepiece of Inevitability

![[Pasted image 20240715183833.png]]
- While this is active, using Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- Applies Inevitable Corruption, Increases your all out and haste by 12% for 20 seconds
	- Using the consumable (6) while this is active applies Snap, dealing high damage after a short delay

I can’t account for the playstyle or use cases myself for the timepieces, the information below is based on SLGMA’s guide.

Refer to his guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHEYDB5JM2qSBFYwVs6Hkj17x24TElB1mtuQUyidv18/edit).

Used with Hourglass of Power + Inevitability due to the extra damage feeded in from snap. For overall higher nukes. There is a complex Hourglass of Transcience rotation with this also.

---
### Timepiece of Madness

![[Pasted image 20240715185417.png]]
- While this is active it applies the following:
	- Auto Attack applies Mad, increasing all out by 3%
		- Once at 5 stacks of Mad, you become eternal
		- Increasing Critical Chance by 80% and decreasing all out by 30%
	- Corruption Through Time (4) applies Potential, increasing hit chance by 20% for seconds

With Hourglass of Power + Madness, the idea is to line up your nukes with the 5 stacks of Mad to deal big funny numbers. There is a Transcience + Madness rotation but you are required to manage your HP well to avoid accidentally dying.

---
### Timepiece of Pestilence

![[Pasted image 20240715190314.png]]
- While this is active, Corruption Through Time (4) applies the following:
	- Infectious Air, increasing damage takes by 20% and stacks to 3 and lasts 10 seconds. Is consumed by Temporal Collapse (5).
	- All In is increased by 100% for 10 seconds
	- Applies a light DoT to your opponent
	- Applies Decay to your opponent

General idea with this timepeice is to gather stacks while nuking. This reduces your own defense so it can be quite risky.

## Enhancements

| Situation          | Enhancements                                   | Rating | Extra Information                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Solo               | Dauntless/Anima/Vainglory or Lament            | 9/10   | Good for all out damage.                        |
| Solo (alternative) | Lacerate or Valiance/Anima/Vainglory or Lament | 8/10   | Can be swapped for Lament for more crit chance. |

There are no farming alternatives here, if you’re ever going to farm with this class you’re going to farm a boss to which you’d use either example above. Don’t use this to farm mobs.

---
## Gameplay/Combos

This class has many consumables but generally with the Hourglass of Power you will not necessarily deviate much from the basic 4 rift combo, though depends on the situation. 

The idea with this is to make sure the Power aura applies before nuking.

**Basic 4 Rift Rotation**
3-4-2-2-2-4-2-5

### Entropic Corruption

With entropic power you will have a much higher haste so you will generally be able to reach much faster nuke cycles. The idea is to apply 6 and 3 first before beginning the cycle so that you get your haste buffs and damage buffs.

**Short Entropic - 5 Seconds**
This is the shortest cycle possible where your nuke multiplier is still positive. With buffs from party you can get away with using less rifts, however it is not recommended due to the fact the cooldown for the nuke is 7 seconds.

6-3-4-2-2-2-5

**Standard Entropic - 7 seconds**
This is the basic rotation, uses all 4 rifts to reach the maximum nuke multiplier. However, doesn’t use the entire 10 seconds to feed in damage.

6-3-4-2-2-2-4-2-5

**Long Entropic - 8 - 10 seconds**
These combos are recommended if the boss has higher HP and you won’t be able to kill it with the standard rotations. To which these rotations may appease you. 

6-3-4-2-2-2-4-2-2-5 (**8 seconds**)
6-3-2-4-2-2-2-4-2-2-5 (**9 seconds**)
4-2-2-2-4-2-2-2-4-5 (**10 seconds**)

### Infinite Corruption

With this you’ll pretty much be unkillable unless you die to a 1 shot. It provides little difference to the base class. Use the basic 4 rift rotation or 3 rift rotation due to lack of haste you may not be able to use the other combos above (unless maybe dauntless?).

**Basic 4 Rift Rotation**
3-4-2-2-2-4-2-5

### Foresee Corruption

While using this you’ll see that the large nukes are going to be 40 seconds apart and it is a better idea to just use any other corruption above. 

6-3-4-2-4-3-4-2-2-3-4-2-2-3 (repeat 4-2-2-3 till 6 is off CD)
4-2-6-4-2-2-2-5-3 (omg big number but you gotta wait 40 seconds till you see it again)

Due to no actual testing of my own, the timepieces I’ll just refer to [SLGMA’s guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHEYDB5JM2qSBFYwVs6Hkj17x24TElB1mtuQUyidv18/edit).

## Extra Information

Refer to the [[Stats & Misc#Chronos and their weird intricacies|Chrono Section]] for the Stats & Misc area for general information, this will be specified for TCM. This section is to tell you how to optimise damage with TCM, I will go over the base class in this section as well as under the effects of particular consumables if they effect the class nukes in any way.

Chronos like TCM are literally funny number machine due to the fact they utilise so many buffs together the damage for nukes is exponential. Utilising pots and 

The base class takes in the following buffs into the nuke:
- All Out
- Mag Out
- Crit Modifier

TCM’s coefficient is 1.3

Rifts multiplier stacks like this:
- 1 Stack = 0.5
- 2 Stack = 0.7
- 3 Stack = 1.0
- 4 Stack and above = 1.5

The base mag out for TCM is at 32% so 1.32

The base crit mod for TCM is at 260% so 2.6 but Hourglass of Power adds an extra 10% or 1.1, so 270%.

All out is at 1.2 or 20% due to the fact you’re most likely going to be nuking while Corruption Through Time (4) effect is active. Hourglass of power itself increases all out by 10% or 1.1 so total is 1.3 or 30% all out.

So our final equation looks like this (this assumes you crit)

$$
RecordedDamageMod = RiftMulti \times Coefficient \times AllOutBuffs \times MagOutBuffs \times CritMod
$$

With the base class this will be at 4 rifts:
`1.5 (4 rifts) x 1.3 (coefficient) x 1.3 (all out buffs) x 1.32 (mag out buffs) x 2.7 (crit mod buffs) = 9.03474`

Damage done during the most recent 10 seconds from the first temporal rift applying, will then be multiplied by the value above at 4 rifts, assuming you are using power.

This is the upper threshold for the damage multiplier without the use of corruptions/pots, however you can shorten your nuke cycles should the boss have less hp, to avoid overkilling. Non-crits are in brackets.
- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 9.034 (3.35)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 6.023 (2.23)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 4.22 (1.56)
- 1 Rift (0.5) - 3.01 (1.12)

Below are the differences with different corruptions/pots.

**Entropic Corruption**
High risk, good reward. Gives 100% all our and extra haste to feed in more damage. Total all out becomes 130%.
- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 15.99 (5.92)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 10.66 (3.95)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 7.46 (2.76)
- 1 Rift (0.5) - 5.33 (1.97)

**Felicitous Philtre**
A potion that grants 50% more luck, pretty great on this chrono due to the fact it applies to the damage you feed in and the actual nuke too. Numbers may vary but should be around the same.

This leads to a 325% crit mod, a boost in other areas but they don’t necessarily apply to our nuke.
- 4 Rifts (1.5) - 10.88 (3.35)
- 3 Rifts (1) - 7.25 (2.23)
- 2 Rifts (0.7) - 5.07 (1.56)
- 1 Rifts (0.5) - 3.62 (1.12)
