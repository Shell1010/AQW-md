You can always refer back to the [wiki](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/valencia-s-quests) but this guide should be concise enough for you. This item is integral for a variety of grinds and provides you with some useful awe enhancements.

Start the Blade of awe by joining /museum, clicking on valencia, Blade of Awe > To the CrossRoads. You then click on valencia again and start her Awe Quests. Each quest item is used to forge the Blade of Awe.

- **"Find the Stonewrit!"**
	- Drops from any dragon monster.
	- /join [etherwardes](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/etherstorm-war-desoloth) and kill any dragons you find till you get the drop.

---

- **"Find the Handle!"**
	- Drops from any elemental monster.
	- /join [gilead](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/ruins-of-great-gilead) and kill any elementals you find till you get the drop.

---

- **"Find the Hilt!"**
	- Drops from any undead monster.
	- /join [shadowfallwar](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadowfall-war-location) and kill enemies in Screen 2.

- **"Find the Blade!"**
	- Drops from any chaos beast.
	- If you haven't completed the mobius storyline, /join [hydra](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/hydra-lake) and kill the hydras at the end.
	- If you have completed the mobius storyline, /join [mobius](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/mobius), click on Dew Drop NPC and click "The Hydra" option, this will teleport you to the 3 hydra heads

- **"Find the Runes!"**
	- Drops from any chaos lord.

You should now be able to craft the Blade of Awe using each of the Legendary quest items. This should allow you to start using Awe enhancements like Spiral Carve, Mana Vamp, Health Vamp, Awe Blast.

At the Crossroads you can get [this sword](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/awethur-s-accoutrements) from valencia in the awe-some gear shop. It provides 25% boost to CP, XP, Gold, and Reputation.
