For the Blinding Light of Destiny the two main prerequisites you should have completed are Doomwood Part 1 and have the [Reinforced Badge](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/bolbadge:20) (slay 100 undead in Screen 4 of [Doomwood Forest](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/doomwood-forest)). 

You can start the questline at [/necropolis](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis) from Artix.

- **"Reforging the Blinding Light"**
	- Grab the [Blinding Light of Destiny Handle](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/blinding-light-of-destiny-handle) from Arryd in [Doomwood Forest](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/doomwood-forest) in the Doomwood Challenge Shop. 

- **"Secret Order of Undead Slayers"**
	- Remember to also grab the [Bonegrinder Medal](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/bonegrinder-medal) also from Arryd from the same shop.

- **"Essential Essences"**
	- Head to [/battleunderb](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under-b) and kill the undead in the first room till they drop x25 Undead Essence.

- **"Bust Some Dust"**
	- Head to [/battleunderb](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under-b) and kill the undead in the first room till they drop x40 Bone Dust

- **"A Loyal Follower"**
	- Repeat the previous two quests till you reach x100 Spirit orbs and turn in to receive your first Loyal Spirit Orb.

---

You are now at the most difficult part of the farm, reach 10,515 spirit orbs! While you are doing this farm make sure to also do the **"Mine Crafting"** daily quest from Artix, for an optimal farm you will need to collect the Copper, Barium and Silver metals from this quest. 

The main way you will be obtaining Spirit Orbs is through this quest. It requires you to play somewhat actively but the rewards are great, can shorten your grind to a few hours.
- **"Soul Searching"**
	- This quest requires your to kill each of the bosses in [/battleundera](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under), [/battleunderb](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under-b) and [/battleunderc](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/battle-under-c)

Alternatively, if you have a strong group you can slay the [Imperial noxus](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/imperial-noxus-monster) at [/necroproject](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necro-project). He drops 40x bone dust a kill and it might actually be optimal if you can kill him fast enough.

Head to Artix's Light Merge and first create the Blinding Mace of Destiny first. You will need the following:
- 2x Bright Aura
- 20x Spirit Orb
- 1x Loyal Spirit Orb
- 7x Undead Energy
- 1x Celestial Copper of Destiny
- 1x Basic Weapon Kit
- 1x Advanced Weapon Kit
- 1x Ultimate Weapon Kit

Once you have merged and created this item you will need to create the Blinding Blade of Destiny and the Blinding Bow of Destiny also. You will need to complete the Ultimate Weapon Kit till you have enough materials, specifically the Spirit Orbs and Loyal Spirit Orbs requirement. Create the Blessed Barium of Destiny and the Sanctified Silver of Destiny from geopetals forge at [/dwarfhold](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dwarfhold-keep), utilise Artix's Light Merge where needed. 

The optimal way is to create the items in this order Blinding Mace > Blinding Blade > Blinding Bow, since you can use Blinding Blade's fragments quest for spirit orbs and loyal spirit orbs.
