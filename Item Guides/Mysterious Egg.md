- **"Mysterious Chest"**
	- You will need to obtain all bankable 7 AC non-member tagged keys from each of the dragons for the [Chest's Quest](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/the-chest-s-quest) for the Mysterious Egg. Click on the dark grey dragon head shape on top of the chest in the [/dragonbone](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragon-bone) map to begin the questlines. Just note you can only keep one copy of a key at a given time. (UNLESS... you place one copy of the key in your bank which won't take up space and farm another copy of the key in your temporary drops so when you turn in the key you can turn it in twice in one go to avail of the rest of the Elemental DragonSlayer set items after getting the Mysterious Egg which [Alina confirmed that this would have a future CharacterPage Badge.](https://x.com/Alina_AE/status/1819066354521034965)
		- You will need to kill the dragons from the following locations for keys:
			- [/pride](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/pride) - Valsarian (RNG medium difficulty)
			- [/wrath](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/wrath-location) and [/dragonbone](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragon-bone) - Gorgorath (RNG easy to medium difficulty)
			- [/sloth](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/sloth) - Phlegnn (RNG easy-medium difficulty)
			- [/lust](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lust) - Lascivia (RNG medium difficulty)
			- [/maloth](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/maloth-location) (Envy) - Maloth (RNG EZ to compensate you for struggling in the two-part zone)
			- [/gluttony](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/gluttony-location) - Glutus or Deflated Glutus (RNG medium-hard difficulty)
			- [/greed](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/greed) - Goregold (RNG easy-medium difficulty)
     		-IS THIS SKIPPABLE? (In all zones except Envy's you can ask a fellow BattleBuddy to taxi you to the boss area since it requires you to do an hour of errands and mini gauntlet respectively.
     		Then by the time you defeat the guard(final boss quest in the zone questline), only then can you be taxi'd without even doing a single quest in /Maloth)
		- Once finished you can get the Mysterious Egg Non-member AC tagged pet and travel to the [/mysteriousegg](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/mysterious-egg-location) location.
		- This pet is used in Dragon of Time's quests, however, if you need the [Shadow Dragon Defender armor](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-dragon-defender) you can do a few extra steps.
			- From here, you have completed [Maya's quests](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/loremaster-maya-s-quests#14) till you get the Manticore cub pet. Use this to open the Shadow Dragon Gear shop and get the [Shadow Dragon Defender armor](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shadow-dragon-defender) used primarily for the Awescension questline.
