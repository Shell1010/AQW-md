This document will be updated as I go on but I intend to have this page be dedicated for guides to reach Rank 10 for each faction reputation. Some factions may have the option for several methods for each reputation. While this isnâ€™t entirely complete with every faction, there is an updated [reputation guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ygALeC-q_iqBBtRJAgIKLio_V_YVm0I5R4CqALLio/edit?usp=sharing) with pretty much every relevant faction. Created by Nepjune from Misfit.

# Good Reputation

You can reach Rank 10 Good Reputation through multiple means, I will list some of the more faster known methods:
- Doing either [**"Good Company"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) or [**"The Sky Opens"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) from Lady Celestia at [/terminatemple](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/termina-temple)
	- [**"Good Company"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) can be completed by defeating the Termina Defenders in the map.
	- [**"The Sky Opens"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lady-celestia-s-quests#Termina) can be completed by heading to [/etherwardes](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/etherstorm-war-desoloth) and killing any of the Dragon Warriors.
- Alternatively you can do the [**"Paradise is Not So Nice"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/alina-s-quests#2) and kill the Bird of Paradise at [/manor](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/manor).
- Completing [**"SlimeZ"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/lim-s-quests) from lim in [/swordhaven](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/swordhaven).
- Completing [**"Tomb with a View"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/king-alteon-s-good-quests) from king alteon at Rank 4 Good.

# Blade of Awe Reputation

This is quite a simple faction and just completing the Blade of Awe quests should give you high reputation.

- You can increase Blade of Awe reputation by completing the [Find the Handle!](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/valencia-s-quests#3) quest till you are Rank 10. This shouldn't take very long as it gives 11,000 Reputation and with a rep boost this goes higher.
	- Drops from any elemental monster.
	- Travel to [/gilead](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/ruins-of-great-gilead) and kill any elementals you find till you get the drop.

# Evil Reputation

- Complete [**"Youthanise"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/gravelyn-s-quests#12).
	- Very easy to do.
- Complete [**"Bone-Afide"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/gravelyn-s-quests#12) at [/swordhavenundead](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/swordhaven-castle-undead) at Rank 4 Evil.
	- Very easy to do.
- Alternatively you can also complete the quests from Shakaz at [/terminatemple](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/shakaz-s-quests#Termina).
- If member use the Swag Token A quest from [malorie](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/malorie-s-quests).
- During Frostval season you can do the [**"Defeat Ultra Frostfang"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/issik-the-vile-s-quests) quest.
	- 3k rep per turn-in.
	- Good with groups.

# Blacksmithing Reputation

- Best way to do this is through the [**"Masterful Metallurgy"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/cysero-s-forge-s-quests) quest in [/forge](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/forge).
	- Do the **"Mine Crafting"** quest in [/necropolis](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necropolis) and obtain iron daily.
	- This stacks to 10 and you can turn these in during a rep boost/server rep boost for the best yield.
- Alternatively if you have a lot of gold you can complete the [**"Interprid Investing"**](http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/cysero-s-forge-s-quests) quest
	- Requires around 30 million gold if you have boosts and server boosts both active
